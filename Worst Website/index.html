        <h1 class="intro white">Meet Viz, the CS1520 locked Ultimate Super Senior. After recently failing to graduate on time I decided to up the ante, and forge my own journey from scratch. No fall semester, no failing another class, but this time I can't leave Pitt. All leading up to eventually taking on one of life's biggest challenges, getting a job.</p>

        <p class="bio">My name is Alex "Viz" Visbisky, and I'm currently taking summer classes to graduate. I've studied Bioinformatics at Pitt for 4 years. I plan on working as Genomic Scientist here at Pitt once I've graduated. My programming background is mainly in Python doing undergraduate research in machine learning to predict electron density of molecules. I have the same origin story as 90% of other CS students, I was horribly addicted to WoW for a long time and have moved on to Old School Runescape <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWbNgaR6qk" target="_blank"><i>incase you didn't understand the intro.</i></a> I work in IT here currently and have been my entire time here. My goal is to make the most <b>"Aesthetic"</b> website without Bootstrap.
